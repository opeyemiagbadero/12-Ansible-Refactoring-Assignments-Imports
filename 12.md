##Ansible Refactoring, Assignments & Imports##

In this project I  continued working with ansible-config-mgt repository and made some improvements on my code. 
Now I need refactored the Ansible code, created assignments, and learnt how to use the imports functionality. 
Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook – it is used to  organize tasks and reuse them when needed.

Step 1 – Jenkins job enhancement
I began by making some changes to our Jenkins job – now every new change in the codes creates a separate directory which is not very convenient when we want to run some commands from one place. Besides, it consumes space on Jenkins serves with each subsequent change. An enhancement is carried out by introducing a new Jenkins project/job –which requires a Copy Artifact plugin.

In the Jenkins-Ansible server, create a new directory called ansible-config-artifact and store all artifacts after each build, change permissions to this directory, so Jenkins can save files here.

Go to Jenkins web console -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> on Available tab search for Copy Artifact and install this plugin without restarting Jenkins

Created a new Freestyle project and name it save_artifacts.

This project will be triggered by completion of the existing ansible project. Configure it accordingly:

The main idea of save_artifacts project is to save artifacts into /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory. To achieve this, I created a build step and choose Copy artifacts from other project, specified ansible as a source project and /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact as a target directory.

![step1-6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111845-58d5169b-88f8-4c51-b181-3533a11898b2.png)

Tested my set up by making some change in README.MD file inside the ansible-config-mgt repository (right inside master branch)

If both Jenkins jobs have completed one after another – you shall see your files inside /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory and it will be updated with every commit to your master branch.
