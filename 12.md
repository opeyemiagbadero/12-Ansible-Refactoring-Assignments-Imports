##Ansible Refactoring, Assignments & Imports##

In this project I  continued working with ansible-config-mgt repository and made some improvements on my code. 
Now I need refactored the Ansible code, created assignments, and learnt how to use the imports functionality. 
Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook – it is used to  organize tasks and reuse them when needed.

Step 1 – Jenkins job enhancement

I began by making some changes to our Jenkins job – now every new change in the codes creates a separate directory which is not very convenient when we want to run some commands from one place. Besides, it consumes space on Jenkins serves with each subsequent change. An enhancement is carried out by introducing a new Jenkins project/job –which requires a Copy Artifact plugin.

In the Jenkins-Ansible server, create a new directory called ansible-config-artifact and store all artifacts after each build, change permissions to this directory, so Jenkins can save files here.

Go to Jenkins web console -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> on Available tab search for Copy Artifact and install this plugin without restarting Jenkins

![step1-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200110798-05803183-48a3-4575-a4ac-f5ddce1e3076.png)

Created a new Freestyle project and name it save_artifacts.

This project will be triggered by completion of the existing ansible project. Configure it accordingly:


![step1-5a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111709-03398b7f-3b8f-4fe6-a5f4-b83ad7e2bef1.png)

![step1-5b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111712-27f08848-2942-419f-bcde-e2c0c2e959d0.png)

The main idea of save_artifacts project is to save artifacts into /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory. To achieve this, I created a build step and choose Copy artifacts from other project, specified ansible as a source project and /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact as a target directory.

![step1-6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111845-58d5169b-88f8-4c51-b181-3533a11898b2.png)

Tested my set up by making some change in README.MD file inside the ansible-config-mgt repository (right inside master branch)

If both Jenkins jobs have completed one after another – you shall see your files inside /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory and it will be updated with every commit to your master branch.

Step 2 – Refactor Ansible code by importing other playbooks into site.yml

Before starting to refactor the codes, I ensured that I pulled down the latest code from master (main) branch, and created a new branch, named refactor.

Let see code re-use in action by importing other playbooks.

Within playbooks folder, create a new file and name it site.yml – This file will now be considered as an entry point into the entire infrastructure configuration. In other words, site.yml will become a parent to all other playbooks that will be developed.

Created a new folder in root of the repository and named it static-assignments. The static-assignments folder is where all other children playbooks will be stored.

Move common.yml file into the newly created static-assignments folder.

Inside site.yml file, import common.yml playbook.

I created another playbook under static-assignments and named it common-del.yml. In this playbook, I configured the deletion of the wireshark utility.

I opened the etc-ansible-ansible config file to edit the inventory file by imputting the path to the inventory file and commenting out the path

I updated site.yml with - import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common-del.yml instead of common.yml and ran it against dev servers:
