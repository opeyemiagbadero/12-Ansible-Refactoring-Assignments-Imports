##Ansible Refactoring, Assignments & Imports##

In this project I  continued working with ansible-config-mgt repository and made some improvements on my code. 
Now I need refactored the Ansible code, created assignments, and learnt how to use the imports functionality. 
Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook – it is used to  organize tasks and reuse them when needed.

Step 1 – Jenkins job enhancement

I began by making some changes to our Jenkins job – now every new change in the codes creates a separate directory which is not very convenient when we want to run some commands from one place. Besides, it consumes space on Jenkins serves with each subsequent change. An enhancement is carried out by introducing a new Jenkins project/job –which requires a Copy Artifact plugin.

In the Jenkins-Ansible server, create a new directory called ansible-config-artifact and store all artifacts after each build, change permissions to this directory, so Jenkins can save files here.

![step1-1 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200110682-8f9f7993-2544-4121-92a5-425f59ef1796.png)

Go to Jenkins web console -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> on Available tab search for Copy Artifact and install this plugin without restarting Jenkins

![step1-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200110798-05803183-48a3-4575-a4ac-f5ddce1e3076.png)

Created a new Freestyle project and name it save_artifacts.

![step1-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111726-4fada26a-1ddd-475a-a543-bca76607b380.png)

This project will be triggered by completion of the existing ansible project. Configure it accordingly:


![step1-5a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111709-03398b7f-3b8f-4fe6-a5f4-b83ad7e2bef1.png)

![step1-5b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111712-27f08848-2942-419f-bcde-e2c0c2e959d0.png)

The main idea of save_artifacts project is to save artifacts into /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory. To achieve this, I created a build step and choose Copy artifacts from other project, specified ansible as a source project and /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact as a target directory.

![step1-6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111845-58d5169b-88f8-4c51-b181-3533a11898b2.png)

Tested my set up by making some change in README.MD file inside the ansible-config-mgt repository (right inside master branch)

If both Jenkins jobs have completed one after another – you shall see your files inside /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory and it will be updated with every commit to your master branch.

![step1-7a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111962-f401c315-34ad-479b-a5ca-860ab7353924.png)


![step1-7b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200111966-af3d04df-3f37-4da8-b97f-14884e0f8ea1.png)

Step 2 – Refactor Ansible code by importing other playbooks into site.yml

Before starting to refactor the codes, I ensured that I pulled down the latest code from master (main) branch, and created a new branch, named refactor.

Let see code re-use in action by importing other playbooks.

Within playbooks folder, create a new file and name it site.yml – This file will now be considered as an entry point into the entire infrastructure configuration. In other words, site.yml will become a parent to all other playbooks that will be developed.

Created a new folder in root of the repository and named it static-assignments. The static-assignments folder is where all other children playbooks will be stored.

Move common.yml file into the newly created static-assignments folder.

Inside site.yml file, import common.yml playbook.

![step 2 1-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200112248-9643ecd3-2974-4bbf-b9b7-acf9f06fee81.png)

I created another playbook under static-assignments and named it common-del.yml. In this playbook, I configured the deletion of the wireshark utility.


![step2 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200112503-ce6a16d3-9f60-4be9-a022-88deab2aaa63.png)

![step2 5a update site yml with - import_playbook  Changed common yml to common-del  Configure the deletion of the wireshark utility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200112507-690a9d49-334d-40e1-8ec0-4255f0c353f7.png)

I opened the etc-ansible-ansible config file to edit the inventory file by imputting the path to the inventory file and commenting out the path
![step2 5b sudo vi the etc-ansible-ansible config fle to edit the inventory file  by iputting the path to the inventory file and commentting out the path ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200112527-74280854-d182-4f6a-9d44-b91624652a4e.png)


![step2 5c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200112540-ac46c21b-075c-40b3-8274-16ded9c2d4fc.png)

Confirmed that all host are connected using the ansible ping command

![step2 5d confirm that all host are connected using the ansible ping coomand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200112547-0f8f05a4-645b-4960-936f-b8e3d088e8bf.png)

I updated site.yml with - import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common-del.yml instead of common.yml and ran it against dev servers:

![step2 5e Run the ansible playbook command](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200112906-82f60a24-8131-49ae-9b4a-16bd74ced112.png)

Confirmed the deletion of wireshark from each of the other servers

![step2 5f  confirm the deletion of wireshark from each of the other servers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200112958-e6fa4dca-2fab-478e-98ea-63b19ff4cf11.png)


Step 3 – Configure UAT Webservers with a role ‘Webserver’

Launched 2 fresh EC2 instances using RHEL 8 image, which were used as the uat servers, namely – Web1-UAT and Web2-UAT.

![step3 1 Launch 2 fresh EC2 instances using RHEL 8 image, we will use them as our uat servers, so give them names accordingly – Web1-UAT and Web2-UAT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200113841-13cf12e5-31b3-4792-9e84-9f823465de61.png)


To create a role, you must create a directory called roles/, relative to the playbook file or in /etc/ansible/ directory.

![step3 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200114157-5837d922-4348-4946-9e85-6fae9b5ba098.png)


the roles structure should like the leftside of the screenshot below. I updated the inventory ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.yml file with IP addresses of my 2 UAT Web servers


![step3 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200114485-30623387-887a-405f-b89a-4a4a8d27bda8.png)

In /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file uncomment roles_path string and provide a full path to the roles directory roles_path    = /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/roles, so Ansible could know where to find configured roles

![step3 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200114555-089f15a5-6b13-4a90-919b-6220994e239c.png)

It is time to start adding some logic to the webserver role. Go into tasks directory, and within the main.yml file, start writing configuration tasks to do the following:
Installed and configured Apache (httpd service), Cloned Tooling website from GitHub https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/tooling.git.
Ensured the tooling website code is deployed to /var/www/html on each of 2 UAT Web servers and made sure httpd service was started.
The main.yml will consist of following tasks:

![step 3 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200115264-d5a2987d-7e52-49b5-8bc0-d086822b3000.png)


Step 4 – Reference ‘Webserver’ role

Within the static-assignments folder, I created a new assignment for uat-webservers uat-webservers.yml. This is where I referenced the roles

![Uploading step 4a.png…]()


Remember that the entry point to our ansible configuration is the site.yml file. I referred to the uat-webservers.yml role inside site.yml. as found in the site.yml file.

![Uploading step3 4b.png…]()


Step 5 – Commit & Test


Committed the changes, created a Pull Request and merged them to master branch, made sure webhook triggered two consequent Jenkins jobs, they ran successfully and copied all the files to the Jenkins-Ansible server into /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/ directory.

I ran the playbook against the uat inventory using the command  *sudo ansible-playbook -i /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.yml /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/playbooks/site.yaml*

![Uploading step 5f ran ansible playbook succesfully.png…]()

Reached the UAT web servers from my browser.


![Uploading step 5h You should be able to see both of your UAT Web servers configured and you can try to reach them from your browser.png…]()

The Ansible architecture now looks like this:
